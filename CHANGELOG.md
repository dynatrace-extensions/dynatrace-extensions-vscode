### ⚠️ Special notes:
- Since this is a live version available on Marketplace it will appear as a new extension.
  This means any previous version should be removed and any workspaces will have to be initialized again.
- Starting with this version, the Copilot only supports fused credential files.
  If you want to use an older format (key & certificate as separate files) you must paste the contents manually and create a fused file.
