Code completions or suggestions happen at key points within the extension manifest. 
Either automatically or on-demand (using `Ctrl + Space`) these offer known values that
can be inserted at the location of your cursor.

<p class="notice--info">
    <strong>üìù Note:</strong>
    <br/>
    Suggestions from other extensions (such as YAML Schema) may take precedence
    over the Copilot's.

## Demo

## Currently implemented triggers

- on `fromType:` and `toType:` attributes of any `topology.relationships` item
- on `sourceAttribute:` and `destinationAttribute:` attributes of any relationship based on
  entity mapping rules (provided you have already filled in `fromType` and `toType` respectively)
- on `entityType:` and `entityTypes:` anywhere in the yaml, relevant entity types are suggested
- on lists of attribute-type properties, on `key:` the keys of relevant entity attributes are
  suggested
- on `entitySelectorTemplate:` you can make use of Ctrl + Space to trigger completions as the 
  selector is being built
- on `entitySelectorTemplate:` you can auto-complete selectors for relationships that are seen
  in the YAML
- on `iconPattern:` (within `topology.rules`) or `icon:` (within `staticContent.header`) - you can 
  browse available Barista Icon codes
- on `key:` for card keys either inside `layout.cards` or individual card type lists - card keys
  that have not been used yet are suggested
- on `value:` for metrics and dimensions of a prometheus extension if data has been scraped
  already
- on `description:` in metrics section for those metrics that have been scraped from a 
  Prometheus endpoint
