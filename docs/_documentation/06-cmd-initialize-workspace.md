Initializes a new workspace for Dynatrace Extension (2.0) Development.
This includes loading up schemas, creating extension folder and stub, and creating an empty dist folder.
This will also configure the `yaml.schema` extension to validate `extension.yaml` with your chosen schema version.
Once finished, the workspace appears in the new Dynatrace view.
