Once the Copilot is installed your editor will show the Dynatrace icon in its activity bar.
Use the Extension Workspaces view to keep track of all your projects and easily switch between.

## Use cases

### Manage your extension projects

Keep track of all workspaces containing extension projects, regardless of where on your filesystem
they are stored. Use the `+` icon of the view header or run the 
[Initialize workspace command](/docs/cmd/initialize-workspace/) to add a new extension workspace.
Use the icon next to each workspace label if you want to remove it.

Expand the row to see which extension is part of it as well as its latest version.

### Easily access any of your extensions

Next to the workspace label, the folder icon allows you to open the directory associated with that
workspace.

Next to the extension name label, the file icon allows you to "peek" into the extension manifest.
This doesn't open a new window, making it ideally for taking quick glances into your previous work.
