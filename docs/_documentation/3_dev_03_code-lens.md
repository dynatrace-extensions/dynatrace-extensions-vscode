For Dynatrace Extensions, these can help trigger code-related actions to your connected
tenant or other external endpoints.

## Entity Selector Code Lenses

- See the last validation status of any entity selector
- Validate any entity selector against a connected Dynatrace tenant
- Run any entity selector and visualize the query results in the Dynatrace output panel

## Prometheus Code Lenses

- Connect to a Prometheus endpoint and scrape metrics data. Scraped details can then be used:
  - To automatically insert metric definitions in the `prometheus` section of the YAML
  - To automatically insert dimensions in the `prometheus` section of the YAML
  - To automatically insert metric metadata in the `metrics` section of the YAML
- Get a timestamp of when details were last scraped.

- Run WMI queries against the local Windows machine where a WMI extension is being developed
  - To validate that the WMI query is valid
  - To browse the results of the query and check the column values
  - To get the number of unique dimensions that a query would create for this machine
