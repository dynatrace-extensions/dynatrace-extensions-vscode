The extension will highlight actions to add snippets of code where possible.
On lines with specific keywords, the lightbulb (ðŸ’¡) icon will show up to list things that can be
automatically added to the code.

Currently implemented action triggers:

- inside `propertiesCard` when clicking on `properties` - you can automatically add properties
  for the entity's attributes and relations
- inside `entitiesListCards` when clicking on `columns` - you can automatically add columns for
  the listed entity's attributes and relations
- inside `chartsCards` and `entitiesListCards` when clicking on `charts` inside a card - you can
  automatically add charts for metrics that aren't already in the card
- inside `graphChartConfig` when clicking on `metrics` - you can add additional metrics to your 
  chart, that aren't already used within the surrounding card

  entire feature sets of metrics
