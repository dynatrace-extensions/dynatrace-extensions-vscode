## Installing the VisualStudio Code Extension

Right now, the extension is not published to the marketplace you'll have to install it from the `.vsix` file packaged in every [release](https://github.com/dynatrace-extensions/dynatrace-extension-developer/releases).

Open Visual Studio Code, then open the Extensions menu, click the "..." and choose "Install from VSIX..".
