Many times perfectly valid YAML still produces a manifest that causes issues when we upload the
extension to Dynatrace or later when it tries to execute. Many of these situations can be caught
early and the Copilot aims to bring these to light so you can fix them and reduce the number of
deployment attempts.

## How do diagnostics work in VS Code?

> Coming soon

## Currently implemented diagnostics

> Note: The code itself doesn't mean anything, it just provides a unique identifier within all
> diagnostics that may come up in VS Code.
