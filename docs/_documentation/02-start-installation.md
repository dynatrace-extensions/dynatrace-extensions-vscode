Right now, the extension is not published to the marketplace so you'll have to install
it using the `.vsix` file packaged in every
[release](https://github.com/dynatrace-extensions/dynatrace-extension-developer/releases).

Open Visual Studio Code, then open the Extensions menu, click the "..." and choose
"Install from VSIX..". Select the `.vsix` file downloaded and wait for VS Code to confirm
the installation was successful.

    <strong>üìù Note:</strong>
    <br/>
    VS Code will also automatically install the
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml">
        YAML extension
    </a> by RedHat. This is used to enforce schema validation for your extension's yaml.
