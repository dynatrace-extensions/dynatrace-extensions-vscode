Code actions happen on key lines of your extension manifest.
Your editor will automatically show a lightbulb (ðŸ’¡) icon whenever actions exist relevant to the
current line of your manifest. 

Actions may include:
- Generating & inserting content into the manifest
- Fixing issues highlighted by the Copilot
