The Dynatrace Extensions Copilot is a Visual Studio Code extension that aims to provide support
for all aspects of developing Dynatrace Extensions 2.0.

It supports developers by providing a specialised toolkit that is ready to use without further
setup requirements and whose functionality is fully embedded into their code editor.

The Copilot helps users take their extension development practice to the next level by offering
help in three distinct areas:
1. Management & operation automation
2. Content creation automation
3. Content validation

## Features

**Management & operation automation**
- Manage extension 2.0 projects at scale
- Oversee extension deployments across multiple environments
- Run extension development/lifecycle operations straight from your editor
  - Create, build, upload, and activate extensions
  - Create and manage credentials needed for signing extension packages

**Content creation automation**
- Generate Unified Analysis screen content automatically
- Generate documentation, dashboards, and alerts for your extensions
- Generate metrics, dimensions, and metadata directly from Prometheus exporters or WMI Queries
- Leverage code-completions for values compliant with your Dynatrace tenant

**Content validation**
- Automatically ensure you comply with target versions of the Extensions 2.0 schemas
- Benefit of SME diagnostics beyond schema validation
- Check presence/validity of data against your Dynatrace tenant (e.g. metric & entity selectors)
